# Bear Pea Hunt

This repository contains a small browser game written in TypeScript. A bear roams an isometric field eating green peas in pods. Use the arrow keys to move the bear around.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Open `index.html` in your browser or run `npm start` to serve it locally.

## Deployment

To deploy on GitHub Pages:

1. Commit the `dist` and project files to your repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages on the repository settings, serving from the `main` branch (or a `gh-pages` branch if preferred).
3. Visit the GitHub Pages URL to play the game.

Enjoy!
